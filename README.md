## Deployment
The following steps were taken to deploy this site:

1. The project was originally set up in an online repo on GitHub, with some test pages and an example modal created
2.  The project was immediately deployed to git pages, to ensure there would be no deployment issues
3. Under settings/pages, the main branch was selected as the source
4. Each developer worked on a separate branch from the main
5. The project was edited in VS code in a local dev area  
6. Regular commits were added with descriptive commit messages
7. Commits were pushed to GitHub regularly.  Branches were merged with the main branch regularly, ensuring all merge conflicts were easily resolved.  
8. Link to live site:

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.
